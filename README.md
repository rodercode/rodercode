### ðŸš€ Roder Code 

Greetings! I'm a Software Developer student set to graduate in three months, with a focus on both frontend and backend development. My passion for technology and problem-solving has fueled my journey through the intricate world of web development. I'm eagerly looking forward to applying my skills and innovative approaches to tackle real-world challenges and contribute to the tech industry. When I'm not in the office, I play video games for creative inspiration and take long walks to clear my mind. Both activities help me grow personally and professionally.
